# DSH
Discord Shell (DSH)

This is a basic discord shell, meant to mock SSH!

---

## Install
- Make sure [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and Python-pip are installed.
- Run this command in terminal
- ```pip install discord``` // Installs the 'discord' library required for running a bot


## How to Use
- Download the script
- Go to [Discord Developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new bot
- Copy the bot token and paste it in the last line of the script.
- Make sure the bot is set to **Private** and all **Privileged Gateway Intents** are enabled
- Make sure that only you can send commands to this bot, so that nobody else can "DSH" into your PC.


## idk what to put here.
- I'm not gonna say the same 'ol thing. - "tHiS iS fOr EdUcAtIoNaL PuRpOsEs oNLy"
- Well, this "tool" is meant to be used on servers which you own, and cannot readily SSH into them.
- You can send commands to it from your phone too.
- You can send commands to your home server from anywhere in the world without [port forwarding](https://wikiless.org/wiki/Port_forwarding) it, which comes with its own complications and risks
- Enjoy :)
